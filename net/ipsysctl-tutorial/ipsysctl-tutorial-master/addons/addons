Basically, just add a new backend (pdf backend already exist, but doesn't work nice for me nor
for you it seems...).

Just copy the file fabpdf
into /usr/share/sgml/docbook/utils-0.6/backends/fabpdf
(for me, for you it might be another
directory, to know the right path, just type :
# jw -b toto
jw: There is no backend called "/usr/share/sgml/docbook/utils-0.6/backends/toto".
so here my directory is /usr/share/sgml/docbook/utils-0.6/backends/
)

Then move eps_to_png into /usr/bin/ or anywhere else in your path.

I've modified your makefiles already,
it should work nice for pdf...
