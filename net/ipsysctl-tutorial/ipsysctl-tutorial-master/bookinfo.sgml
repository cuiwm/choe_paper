  <title>Dedications</title>

  <para> This document is dedicated to all of you who send me reports of
bugs and errors in what I have written, and to everyone else for that
matter who reads this and other documentations in order to find errors and
report them to the maintainers. This document is in other words dedicated
to everyone who uses what others produce and release for free under the
Free Licenses that are available.
  </para>

  <para>
I would also like to dedicate this to my family who has understood me when
I didn't deserve it, who whacked my head off for being a bum when I
deserved it, and for being a generally nice bunch of people with a lot of
humour.

  <title id="whythisdoc.title">Why this document</title>

  <para> I started writing this documentation in the hopes that it would
help people understand the IP options provided by Linux 2.4, and what you
can do with these options. This is a plain text documentation, hoping to
give the necessary understanding and help to configure your kernel on the
fly, and to get it up and running in a way that suites you. A lot of these
options can also be used to increase performance, as well as strengthen
the security.  We will not discuss all the different sections of the
sysctl in this document, but instead focus on the network sections of the
system control, or sysctl as it is called. Hopefully this documentation
will fill a gap in the documentation, and if you're reading this, it
probably has. Mainly, there are no really good documentations detailing
the whole structure of all the ipsysctl from what I have seen that
documents all the networking options, except the ip-sysctl.txt file in the
linux kernel documentation, which is really really brief in explaining
what the options could be used for.
  </para>

  <para> I believe there is a lot of documentation out there detailing the
usage of these options and variables, however, none of them brings them
together and describes them in detail. If you found this document to be a
good read, or interesting in general, feel free to donate, help out,
translate, or whatever you feel like. The main thing of all however, send
bugreports so I can update the document and see to it that there is no
stale errors or problems due to changes in the kernel etcetera. If you
find an sysctl command that has not been documented here, or is not
listed, send me a mail and I will try to get it inserted as soon as
possible.
  </para>

  <title id="intendedaudience.title">Intended audience & prerequisite knowledge</title>
  <para>
This document is intended for evyerone with an intermediate 
through advanced understanding of TCP/IP as well as the Linux operating 
system. You should understand TCP/IP fairly well, as well as understand 
what a packet header is and what parts it consists of. You will also need 
a lot of understanding of routing and the core of TCP/IP networking.
  </para>

  <para>
In general, this document was not intended for the novice Linux user, but 
you may have some luck checking through this document if you are 
experiencing specific needs. Be absolutely 100% certain that you have 
understood the variables in question before you do change them though, 
since some of them may cause really interesting results. 
  </para>

  <para>
This document should be readable by anyone who has a interest in computers 
and computer networks in specific, and prerequisite knowledge. It is aimed 
at giving a basic understanding of the different variables available 
through the ipsysctl, but also to make it easier to go even further in 
understanding what each specific variable do. 
  </para>

 <section id="howtoread">
  <title id="howtoread.title">How to read</title>

  <para> This documentation can be read any way you want. If there are
specific sections you are interested in, read those. If you have never set
a kernel variable in linux before in your life, read the first chapter
after this and then read the sections you feel intrigued by. If you feel
like reading it from top to bottom, do that. If you feel like reading it
backwards to find hidden messages, do that. If you feel like reading in
encrypted format, well, nothing is stopping you.
  </para>


  <para> What I am trying to say is the following, read the sections that
you want to read and that you think would be informative to you, and if
there is something you do not understand, read the corresponding bits
either here or in some other document. I will not tell you how to read
this document since everyone will probably have bits and pieces they
already know how they work.

 <section id="acknowledgement">
  <title id="acknowledgement.title">Acknowledgements</title>

  <para>This document is loosely based upon the documentation found in 
/usr/src/linux/Documentation/networking/ip-sysctl.txt. Before I say anything 
else, I would like to thank the people who took the time to write that
document. People who read both documents will find that this document has 
borrowed some structure from it.
  </para>
 
  <para> I would like to acknowledge the work done by all the people
working on the networking stack and the timeconsuming job they are putting
into the Linux operating system. I hope I can give something back by
writing this, and other documents, to the community and by giving the
coders a little relief by maintaining documentation for what they have
written.
  </para>

  <para> I would also like to acknowledge Fabrice Marie for the wonderful
help and support with documentation standards and giving me a nudge in the
right direction when there is something I did not get to work. Also, a
huge thanks to all of the people at the netfilter mailing list
for helping out with problems and questions, and the linuxsecurity people
for listening to all of my rants and waiting for all of my excuses for not
getting things published in time.
  </para>

  <para>
In other words, a huge thanks to everyone for helping me out when I have
problems and questions.
